# Pixel Art Maker Project


## Introduction

* "Pixel Art Maker" project is a part of Udacity's _Intro to Programming Nanodegree_. In this project, I built a single-page web app that allows people to draw the pixel art with customizable color and canvas.

## Required skills

* Basic HTML
* Basic CSS
* JavaScript 

## Instructions
* In this project, the starter code such as HTML and CSS has been provided. We need to wirte JavaScript code to fulfill the fucntion of Pixel Art Maker, in which users can generate the grid of squares to represent their design and the color is changable. Specifically, the users can:
1. Dynamically change the size of canvas 
2. Set the color 
3. Click a cell in the grid to paint that cell with the picked color

## Test
* Download or clone this repository
* Open the index.html with browser (Recommended: Google Chrome)

## Note
* Color picker won't function in Safari.
